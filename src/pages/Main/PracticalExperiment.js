            4.1 Shape
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning of
            the practical experiment, a <br />
            basic setting to develop a graphic image series is <br />
            required. This visual experiment uses an eight-by-eight <br />
            basic grid system. In the digital environment, designers <br />
            and developers are using a multiplication by eight. For <br />
            example, most screens of digital products follow eight-
            <br />
            bit resolution systems such as 360px, 720px, or 1280px. <br />
            The sequencing system is adapted to each graphic <br />
            series. Through this sequential system, graphic images <br />
            could be predicted as an animation with various <br />
            movements. Each sequence has 5 scenes, and each <br />
            scene is arranged in chronological order. Paul Ekman's <br />
            six universal facial expressions are applied to this <br />
            experiment: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, <br />
            and surprise. In addition, the neutral position is also <br />
            considered in the experiment. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to
            form-based research at the <br />
            Pennsylvania State University, features of graphic <br />
            shapes can affect one’s experience of emotions. Line <br />
            segments, angles, continuous lines, and curves can be <br />
            features of graphic shapes, and these features affect <br />
            visual recognition. Features of human facial expressions <br />
            are also studied in the process. In addition, not only <br />
            visual and physical elements, but also emotional and <br />
            abstract emotions were used in the visual experiment. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The visual
            experiment started with the line-image <br />
            series (Fig. 6). The horizontal line is used in a neutral <br />
            situation. On the black background, the graphics are <br />
            presented by white lines. The images are designed to be <br />
            simple but considered readable and distinguished. The <br />
            interesting point of the experiment is that, based on the <br />
            horizontal line, the higher the line, the more positive it
          </Text>
        </Col>
        <Col>
          <Text>
            <br />
            <br />
            feels, while the lower the line, the more negative it feels. <br />
            For example, the lines in the happiness images are <br />
            going up, and represent a positive feeling. However, in <br />
            general the lines in the sadness images are going down <br />
            and represent negative feelings. Another interesting <br />
            aspect of the experiment is that, in general, lines are <br />
            used in the experiment to express natural and organic <br />
            feelings in the image curves; however, to express the <br />
            emotion of anger, sharp angles are used in the images <br />
            as a rule. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second visual
            experiment (Fig. 7) uses a solid <br />
            form. The circle is used for a neutral emotion in this <br />
            series. Compared to the line-image series, the second <br />
            series shows a more organic mood. And in the case of <br />
            lines, the movement is limited on the left and right <br />
            because the double-ended points are fixed, while solid <br />
            shapes have no restrictions on the up and down <br />
            movement. However, because the outline of the shape <br />
            has to be connected, the amount of space that can be <br />
            expressed is smaller. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third series
            (Fig. 8) of the basic shape also is <br />a solid form, but the
            rectangle is used for the neutral <br />
            emotion. Some of the images in this series are inspired <br />
            by Ellsworth Kelly's artwork, which has a very clear and <br />
            minimal shape but creates a strong impression. In this <br />
            series, the solid form can be divided, cut, and dissolved. <br />
            As the image series of the anger emotion shows, some <br />
            of the angles cut into the form itself. Compared to the <br />
            second series (Fig. 9), the third series shows a sharper <br />
            and more angular feeling. Because the graphic shapes <br />
            start to change from a shape with four sharp angles.

            4.2 Color
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this chapter,
            color is associated with the <br />
            graphic images developed. In the color scheme of <br />
            Plutchik, sadness and surprise are the same as blue. <br />
            Also, Plutchik's color scheme is based on eight basic <br />
            emotions, while this experiment is based on six basic <br />
            emotions. To solve this problem, the other color table is <br />
            applied in the experiment. The color table used in <br />
            research published in HRI 2013 is adapted in this study. <br />
            The colors added to each facial expression were as <br />
            follows. <br />
            <br />• Happiness: orange <br />• Sadness: blue <br />• Fear: green
            <br />• Disgust: purple <br />• Anger: red <br />• Surprise: yellow

            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The selected colors
            are applied to each series of <br />
            the experiment. The image (Fig.9) shows afterimages of <br />a
            movement. With the afterimage, movements could be <br />
            read in one scene. In the visual experiment with the color <br />
            system, each emotion-image series is imbued with a <br />
            more individual character. However, the color system <br />
            could be subjective due to cultural and social factors; <br />
            thus, someone can agree and disagree with the colors. <br />
            For example, blue color for sadness or red color for <br />
            anger can be agreed to by the vast majority of people. <br />
            But green as a color for fear could be controversial. <br />
            However, even though the color system does not work <br />
            perfectly for the reader, the color system still has an <br />
            essential function: that of classifying the six emotions. <br />
            Readers can easily recognize and distinguish each <br />
            expression of an emotion.

            4.3 Movement
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the visual
            experiment with movement (Fig.10), <br />
            each moving shape showed how detailed options of <br />
            animation affect a natural movement. In order to create <br />a
            natural-looking movement, many kinds of animation <br />
            options are considered. For example, if the animation <br />
            speed is just same in every sequence, it looks unnatural. <br />
            Variable speed effects in the animation make the shape <br />
            look more natural and organic. The six-emotion series,

            <br />
            which are developed by the former experiment, were <br />
            tested in the movement experiment, and each emotion <br />
            needed different animation effects. For example, the <br />
            movement for the emotions of sadness or disgust is very <br />
            slow, while the movement for the emotions of fear or <br />
            surprise is quick and subject to diverse changes. Each <br />
            emotion has its own features and character, thus the <br />
            animation effects should suitably express each emotion.
